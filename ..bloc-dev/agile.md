# What are the typical Agile team roles?
> Typical agile roles include Product Manager, Designer and User Researcher on the Design side, and Project Manager, Team Lead and Developers on the Development side. 

# What parts of the development lifecycle is each role responsible for?

* Design: 
	* Product Manager-responsible for strategy, product roadmap, feature definition and product line definition
	* Designer-responsible for the look (UI) and feel (UX) of the product. Designers create wireframes, mock-ups, prototypes, and interactions with the product. 
	* User Researcher-responsible for understanding and prioritizing user wants, needs, priorities, and behavior. Can further be broken down into UX and UI researchers depending on the complexity of the project. 

* Development:
	* Project Manager-responsible for process management and on-time delivery of product teams. In an agile enviroment a PM is a way to connect to the steering committee.
	* Team Lead-responsible for the technical management, direction, and quality of one or more projects. Team lead may be a manager or individual contributor. 
	* Developers responsible for all aspects of technical creation, maintenance, and overall product integrity.

# What is a Kanban board?
> Kanban boards is a workflow visualization tool that enables workflow optimization for cross-functional departments. Physical and e-boards exist that allow for visualization of software setting workflow. These boards are organized by columns, these columns vary to meet the teams needs at the time. Technical product teams columns usually consist of a Backlog, Commited, Blocked, In Progress, In Test, Deployed and Approved columns. 

# Why do we use a Kanban board in Agile development?
> Kanban boards allow for organization and visualization of workflow. This also allows the employement of a Dual-Track system efficiently and prevents the groups from having dead time. 

* Benefits
	* Estimates-flexible planning
	* Continuous work flow through task management 
	* Visualization of work flow through metrics
	* Collaboration-increased team motivation and self-governance capacity
	* Increased problem solving and risk management within teams


# Explain velocity, sprint, user story, card, and agile as if you were teaching another student. Give a real-world example for each.

* velocity-points attributed to tasks that are accomplished per a sprint on average. A team recieves points for the work they accomplish and these points are compared to weekly averages. 

* sprint-time delineated work cycle for a product team. Sprints can normally range from one week to one month, with two weeks being the most common. This is the iteration of the project where the team does the work. 

* user story-framework in the form of "As a __, I want __ so that__."
  User stories can be from many perspectives: end-user, developer, stakeholder, etc.
  Ex:As a user, I want a drop down so that I can access multiple sections of a website.

* card-the smallest workflow definition or completed unit of work.
ex: Story card with priority and estimate. Can include user story, Tasks, Epic and other relevant details. 

* agile-a product development methodology that utilizes rapid production of software that aligns with the needs of the userbase. Agile temas utilize continuous integration or delivery and iterative development cycles. The concept of "fail fast" is employeed to convey the ideology of quick learning and quick deployment. Agile is the philosophy while specific methodology such as Scrum is a specific methodology. 

# What are different estimation methods teams can use? Explain pros and cons of each method. Which method would you prefer?

* Planning Poker-participants use specially-numbered playing cards to vote for an estimate of an item. Voting repeats with discussion. Used to estimate a small number of items, usually 2-10.

* The Bucket System-same sequence as Planning Poker, estimates of items by placing them in buckets. Much faster Agile estimation technique than Planning Poker for devide-and-conquer phase. Useful for larger groups and usually 50 to 500 items.

* Big/Uncertain/Small-Items are placed in one of the three groups. Uses bucket system divide-and-conquer to go through most of the items after discussing a few together.

* TFB/NFC/1-Similar to Big/Uncertain/Small. The categories are Too-F-ing Big, No F-ing Clue, and 1 Sprint or less. 

* Dot Voting-could be useful for estimating a small number of items. Each person gets a small number of dots and uses them as votes to indicate the size of an item, more dots mean bigger. 

* T-Shirt sizes-items are catagorized into XS, S, M, L, XL. These sizes can have numeric values after estimation is done. Very informal and used to quickly estimate in large groups. Decisions are usually based on open, collaborative discussion. 

* Affinity Mapping-items are grouped by similarity, where similarity is some dimension that needs to be estimated. Usually a very physical activity and requires a relatively small number of items of 20-50. The groupings are then associated with numerical estimates. 

* Ordering Protocol-Items are placed in a random order on a scale labeled low to high, Each person takes turns making a move. A move involves a change of the position of an item by one spot lower or one spot higher, talking about an item or passing the move. If everyone passes the ordering is done. 

* Divide until Maximum Size or Less-group decides on a maximum size for items. Each item is discussed to determine if it is already that size or less. If the item is larger than the maximum size, then the group breaks the item into sub-items and repeats the process with the sub-items. This will continue until all items are in the allowed size range. ex: 1-person-day-of effort.

# Explain the difference between tasks, cards, stories, slices, and epics, as if you were teaching another student. Give a real-world example of a development project, and explain the breakdown of pieces into each type.

* tasks-include every item that must be done for the card to complete, there may be one or multiple tasks for a card. 

* cards-represent the smallest unit of work that can provide value to a user. Cards include estimation, User Story, Task, Epic and other relevant details. 

* stories-can be written from the perspective of user, product owner or developer. 
Ex: As a user, I want to see a list of billed items, so I can manage my accounts.

* slices-work broken down either horizontally by feature or vertically by stack layer. Slices are comprised of a variety of cards necessary to complete the goal. Slices enable a team to see measurable progress and reach milestones or goals on large projects. 

* epics-a story classification that is a new feature or a new product. Discovery may be comprised of multiple epics. 

>In a real world project epics would be features of a product or product lines, an example would be adding loan calculator to a banking application. This would further be broken down into slices such as a home loan calculator, car loan calculator and personal loan calculator. Further these slices will break down into cards that will have user/developer/steakholder stories with estimates. This will further break down into tasks that will have to be done to complete the given card.

# What format makes a good user story?
```As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >```

# What elements should a card include?
>Any information that is valuable enough to waste some place on the card:

* Name/Short Description

* Project Name/ID

* Workflow related dates

* Card ID

* User Story

* **Estimation** , DueDate, Priority

* Tasks

* Epic



# How does an idea go from conception to production?
>The Agile Software Development Life Cycle:

* Concept(Iteration 1)-Select the project.

* Inception-Initiate the project.

* Construction Iterations-Deliver a working system that meets the changing needs of stakeholders. 

* Transition-Deploy Release #N into production 

**OR**

* Start work on release #N+1

* Production-Operate and support release #N

* Retirement-Remove system completely from production


# Why do development teams use Kanban boards?
>Kanban Boards are a visual workflow tool that allows the best collabortaion, iterative development and user input. 


# What is the purpose of estimation?
> Estimation allows to determine the relative time and complexity of a piece of work. 

# What is the sprint cycle?
> The sprint cycle begins with looking at the product backlog -> picking what to work on->conducting sprint planning->looking at the sprint backlog->breaking up and estimating stories->breaking down tasks->conducting daily stand-ups->conducting show and tell of iterative products->repeating the process while conducting a sprint review and retrospective phases before planning the sprint again.

# What could go wrong when estimating cards? How would you mitigate these risks?
 
* Too much or not enough precision could be used based on the planning cards technique used. Too much precision is one of the biggest issues since it will lead to wasted time in arguing between minor distinctions.

* Missunderstanding that the estimation is not based on time, but relative size of the task. This will lead to more time wasted in scale arguments. 

* Estimating cards is inconsistent across teams

* Easy to fall to Drift. With abstract numbers, and no unit of measure it is very easy for estimates to drift over time and adopt different scales across teams. 

> Mitigating these risks can be achieved through using smaller team sizes, not focusing on minor scale arguments, and producing some scale of reference for tasks. 

# Imagine you are looking to lease a new apartment. Write each card that would be in the apartment lease epic. Estimate each card. What columns would you need to have on your Kanban board?

>For this non-technical kanban board I would use 4 columns: To-Do, In-Process, Incomplete, and Complete sections. I would further break down the columns to have expedite rows. 

## Cards: 
  
* Filling out the Application 
  Application Fee payment
  -XL

* Proof of income submition

* Credit check submit 
  Background Check submit 
  -L

* Landlord References submit

# Imagine you are creating a nursery for a new baby. Write each card that would be in this epic. Estimate each card. What columns would you need to have on your Kanban board?

>This is more product centric, thus the Kanban board would have a Backlog, Committed, Blocked, In Progress, In Test, Deployed sections. This many columns are not really needed for the barebones of this kanban board, however, it's better to have a test phase for the materials before placing your baby in the new nursery. 

## The following estimations are under the assumption that this will be a "do it yourself" job and not a purchase.

* The crib
  Crib Bedding
  -XL

* Changing Table
  -S

* Nursery Chair
  -L

* Storage 
  -XS

* Decor
  -M


## The nursery is an interesting example, the following cards that I have defined should however be epics of their own and the nursery be the overall project. The question should be asked in a different manner in my opinion. They are all products that will reside within the nursery project. 

# Imagine you are planning a vacation. Write each card that would be in this epic. Estimate each card. What columns would you need to have on your Kanban board?
>For this non-technical kanban board I would use 4 columns: To-Do, In-Process, Incomplete, and Complete sections. I would further break down the columns to have expedite rows.

* Choose top locales

# What is an MVP?
> MVP stands for minimum viable product. It is a strategy for iterative learning and adapting to your customers. The idea of "learn quickly as possible" is centric to this strategy. You don't strive to build the product that **you** think has the most value, the value and vision is explored through pontential customers. It is the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort, with the goal of adapting feedback from customers/stakeholders. **This does not mean the minimum amount of work you need to do to a product before you can put it to market!**  


# Explain in your own words what a dual-track system is and what advantages it provides.
> A dual-track system utilizes the use of asynchronous work-flow to allow for design and development to always have work and not experience downtime.
