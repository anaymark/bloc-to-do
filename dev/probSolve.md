# Ex1:
>Call for product.loadOnTruck; is not a function call. It needs to read product.loadOnTruck();

# Ex2:
>The product.package(); function was called with an empty argument, therefore the code is saying the shippingType is undefined. To correct the issue the product.package(shippingType); needs to be called.
